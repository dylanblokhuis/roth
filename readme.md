# bevy editor prototype


quick todo thoughts:

- run scene view with just an editor camera with gizmos, runs a different schedule to allow custom stuff
- run game view normally but the editor schedules turned off



# asset drawer

1. Show all files in asset folder 
    \\ tokio fs
2. Be able to load asset by clicking on it, commands get sent to bevy 
    \\ ipc sends the path

3. How to serialize to disk?
    \\ all stuff added 

4. New entity is created
    

<!-- 1. Show list of all "Assets<T>" types
2. Pick between all types with Asset derive -->
